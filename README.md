# SpringBoot 

Spring Security

- Basic security will provide random password with user name as user. You can find the implementation in securityproperties.class file. To give custom user name and password you can change in application.properties
    - spring.security.user.name = "lavanya"
    - spring.security.user.password = "12434"
  Not a good security mechanism just basic one
